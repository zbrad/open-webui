## The Open WebUI Ecosystem 🌐

Open WebUI is the core, surrounded by companion apps and infrastructure that extend what your AI can do, where it can reach, and how you run it:

- 💻 **Open WebUI Computer** ([open-webui/computer](https://github.com/open-webui/computer)): A standalone, mobile-first computer and coding agent that runs on the machine you own. Files, terminal, and git in a browser tab, reachable from your phone. Connect it into Open WebUI as a model, or reach it from Telegram, WhatsApp, and more.

- ⚡ **Open Terminal** and **Terminals (Enterprise)** ([open-webui/open-terminal](https://github.com/open-webui/open-terminal) & [open-webui/terminals](https://github.com/open-webui/terminals)): A self-hosted computing environment that plugs into Open WebUI, giving the AI a place to write code, run it, read output, fix errors, and iterate inside the chat. Terminals gives you per-user isolated containers with separate credentials, resource limits, and network rules. Automatic lifecycle management on Docker or Kubernetes.

- 🔄 **oikb** ([open-webui/oikb](https://github.com/open-webui/oikb)): Feed your Knowledge Bases from 45+ sources (GitHub, Confluence, ServiceNow, Salesforce, Jira, Slack, SharePoint, Notion, and more), keeping the tools your team already uses continuously in sync.

- 🖥️ **Native Desktop App** ([open-webui/desktop](https://github.com/open-webui/desktop)): Run Open WebUI as a native app on macOS, Windows, and Linux. System-wide Spotlight chat bar with screenshot capture, push-to-talk voice, and optional fully-local inference via a built-in llama.cpp engine.

## How to Install 🚀

### Installation via Python pip 🐍

Open WebUI can be installed using pip, the Python package installer. Before proceeding, ensure you're using **Python 3.11** to avoid compatibility issues.

1. **Install Open WebUI**:
   Open your terminal and run the following command to install Open WebUI:

   ```bash
   pip install open-webui
   ```

2. **Running Open WebUI**:
   After installation, you can start Open WebUI by executing:

   ```bash
   open-webui serve
   ```

This will start the Open WebUI server, which you can access at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

### Quick Start with Docker 🐳

> [!NOTE]  
> Please note that for certain Docker environments, additional configurations might be needed. If you encounter any connection issues, our detailed guide on [Open WebUI Documentation](https://docs.openwebui.com/) is ready to assist you.

> [!WARNING]
> When using Docker to install Open WebUI, make sure to include the `-v open-webui:/app/backend/data` in your Docker command. This step is crucial as it ensures your database is properly mounted and prevents any loss of data.

> [!TIP]  
> If you wish to utilize CUDA acceleration, we recommend utilizing our official image tagged `:cuda`. To enable CUDA, you must install the [Nvidia CUDA container toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/dgx/nvidia-container-runtime-upgrade/) on your Linux/WSL system.

### Installation with Default Configuration

- **Default (connect to an OpenAI-compatible API, e.g. llama.cpp)**, use this command:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
  ```

  Point it at your model server after startup via **Admin Settings → Connections**, or set `OPENAI_API_BASE_URL`/`OPENAI_API_KEY` at launch — see [`deploy/local/setup.sh`](deploy/local/setup.sh) for the interactive form used by this fork's own local/systemd deploy scripts.

- **To run Open WebUI with Nvidia GPU support**, use this command:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 --gpus all --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:cuda
  ```

### Installation for OpenAI API Usage Only

- **If you're only using OpenAI API**, use this command:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -e OPENAI_API_KEY=your_secret_key -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
  ```

### Other Installation Methods

We offer various installation alternatives, including non-Docker native installation methods, Docker Compose, Kustomize, and Helm. Visit our [Open WebUI Documentation](https://docs.openwebui.com/getting-started/) or join our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/5rJgQTnV4s) for comprehensive guidance.

### Troubleshooting

Encountering connection issues? Our [Open WebUI Documentation](https://docs.openwebui.com/troubleshooting/) has got you covered. For further assistance and to join our vibrant community, visit the [Open WebUI Discord](https://discord.gg/5rJgQTnV4s).

#### Open WebUI: Server Connection Error

If you're experiencing connection issues, it's often due to the WebUI docker container not being able to reach your model server (e.g. a llama.cpp server on the host) at 127.0.0.1 (host.docker.internal) inside the container. Use the `--network=host` flag in your docker command to resolve this. Note that the port changes from 3000 to 8080, resulting in the link: `http://localhost:8080`.

**Example Docker Command**:

```bash
docker run -d --network=host -v open-webui:/app/backend/data -e OPENAI_API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1 --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
```

### Keeping Your Docker Installation Up-to-Date

Check our Updating Guide available in our [Open WebUI Documentation](https://docs.openwebui.com/getting-started/updating).

### Using the Dev Branch 🌙

> [!WARNING]
> The `:dev` branch contains the latest unstable features and changes. Use it at your own risk as it may have bugs or incomplete features.

If you want to try out the latest bleeding-edge features and are okay with occasional instability, you can use the `:dev` tag like this:

```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:dev
```

### Offline Mode

If you are running Open WebUI in an offline environment, you can set the `HF_HUB_OFFLINE` environment variable to `1` to prevent attempts to download models from the internet.

```bash
export HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1
```
